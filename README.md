# py-partyplayer

Python scripts to play music on a Raspberry Pi. The idea is to be lightweight and fit for the purpose. To use, simply:

1. Edit `src/partyplayer.py` and change `MUSIC_ROOT` to wherever your music is located
2. Create a file `files.txt` containing the path to everything you want to play
3. Execute `src/partyplayer.py`
4. Enjoy!
